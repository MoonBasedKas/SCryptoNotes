\begin{itemize}
    \item What would fall under modern Cryptography?\\
          Encryption, authentication code, digital signatures.\\

    \item What are three defense methods.\\
          Modern Cryptography, software controls, hardware controls, physical controls, security policies and procedures
          user education, and law.

    \item What are 3 security techniques?\\
          Authentication, access control, auditing, intrusion detection, incident handling, cryptography.\\

    \item describe a basic cyber security setting.\\
          Alice a sender and bob the recieve send a message to eachother. There exists another party called the adversaries who will
          attempt to perform maliscous behavior.\\

    \item What is an ideal channel?\\
          A dedicated untappable, impenetrable pipe between sender and reciever.\\

    \item Why don't we have ideal channels commonly in real life.\\
          The internet is a public network.\\

    \item What is the goal of cryptography?\\
          Ensuring the security of communcatino over an insecure channel.\\

    \item What are the 2 goals of security and describe them.\\
          Privacy: Hiding the content of messages from the adversary.\\
          Authenticity(or integrity): Assuring that a message really originate with the sender.\\

    \item What are the two main trust models.\\
          Symmetric and asymmetric setting.\\

    \item what makes a symmetric setting unique?\\
          Both the sender and reciever share a key.\\

    \item What's the chance of an adversary decrypting a string?\\
          $2^{-n}$ where n is the number of bits.\\

    \item What is message authenticity?\\
          It is where the reciever can be sure that the message M originates with the sender with a message authentication code (MAC).\\

    \item Whatare the two keys in an asymmetric setting?\\
          Public and Private keys.\\

    \item What is Non-repudiation?\\
          The inability to go back on an action once it is done.\\

    \item What are some other goals of crptography?\\
          Random number generation, Authenticated key exchange, coin flipping, and zero knowledge proofs.\\

    \item What is a cryptographic protocol?\\
          Instructs parties how to behavior without saying adversaries what to do.

    \item Why is it important to have well designed protocols?\\
          Adversaries will attempt to exploit them.\\

    \item What are the rules of the cryptography game?\\
          Only try to overcome adversaries by means of protocols and keep keys secret but make protocols public.\\

    \item What are the 3 stages of cryptography?\\
          Paper and ink-based scheme.\\
          cryptographic engine-based scheme.\\
          Modern cryptography founded on mathematics.\\

    \item What is the other view of cryptography.\\
          Classic and modern.\\

    \item What is the dividing line in the previously described view and why?\\
          1976/1977 due to the introducion of public key cryptography.\\

    \item What is modern crptography founded upon?\\
          Proof-driven and complexity-theoretic.\\

    \item What is considered shannon secure?\\
          An encryption scheme where for every distribution P it is the case that for every ciphertext C
          which occurs with a nonzero chance, and every message M, we ahve a P$_{M}$(C,M) = P(M).\\

    \item What is a limiation of shannon security?\\
          The number of key bits must be at least as long as the total number of plain text bits.\\
          1 gigbyte plain text means 1 gigabyte cipher.\\

    \item What is compuational compelxity based encryption.\\
          Seek to make something while decryptable take so long to decrypt that they won't be able to realistically do it.\\
          Breakable in principle but not in practice.\\

    \item What are atomic primitives?\\
          The most basic protocols used as a building block for other protocols.\\

    \item What are the two sources for an atomic primitive?\\
          Engineered constructs and mathematical problems.\\

    \item What is the provable-security approach?\\
          Building on the strength of atomic primitives in such a way protocols can inherit the strength.\\
